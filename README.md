# MrFeed

This project is aimed to make a RSS Feed in order to get news for any users.
It is entirely written on HTML and CSS, using Bootstrap 5 framework. See Bootstrap documentation at https://getbootstrap.com.
There are some parts written in JavaScript, put at the bottom of the navbar.html file; they let me using navbar for all pages, loaded by the reference written in footer.

# The core: feed!

I'm going to be busy (very busy, I'd say) with the core of the project: getting news from the world.
Stay tuned and cooperate with me, if you want.

# Usage

Use git clone to get all files, then put them under your /www directory. I'm using Ampss local server (on Windows).
Under the same directory you'll put also your JQuery and JQueryUI frameworks, but if you don't want to use them just delete src put on footer.
