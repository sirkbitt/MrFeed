# MrFeed

This project is aimed to make a RSS Feed in order to get news for any users.
It is entirely written on HTML and CSS, using Bootstrap 5 framework and some little parts of PHP. See Bootstrap documentation at https://getbootstrap.com.
There are some parts written in JavaScript, put at the bottom of the navbar.html file; they let me using navbar for all pages, loaded by the reference written in footer.

# The core: feed!

I'm going to be busy (very busy, I'd say) with the core of the project: getting news from the world.
Stay tuned and cooperate with me, if you want.

# Usage

Use git clone to get all files, then put them under your /www directory. I'm using Ampss local server (on Windows).
Under the same directory you'll put also your JQuery and JQueryUI frameworks, but if you don't want to use them just delete src put on footer.

# Update 13/01/2021

contacts.html has been replaced with contacts.php. It allows to contact the admin of MrFeed (e.g., claims or suggestions) through a local SMTP server (I use Mail Enable).
Comments are inside the file. It contains PHP on top and a JavaScript function at the bottom to check if all fields are correctly filled or not. 
That's not perfect, so if you have any pull please do it.
