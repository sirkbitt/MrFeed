# MrFeed

This project is aimed to make a RSS Feed in order to get news for any users.
It is entirely written on HTML and CSS, using Bootstrap 5 framework. See Bootstrap documentation at https://getbootstrap.com.
There are some parts written in JavaScript, put at the bottom of the navbar.html file; they let me using navbar for all pages, loaded by the reference written in footer.

# The core: feed!

I'm going to be busy (very busy, I'd say) with the core of the project: getting news from the world.
Stay tuned and cooperate with me, if you want.
